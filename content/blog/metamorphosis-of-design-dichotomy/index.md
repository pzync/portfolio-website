John McPhee once said:

> All leads—of every variety—should be sound. They should never promise what does not follow. You read an exciting action lead about a car chase up a narrow street. Then the article turns out to be a financial analysis of debt structures in private universities. You’ve been had. The lead—like the title—should be a flashlight that shines down into the story. A lead is a promise. It promises that the piece of writing is going to be like this. If it is not going to be so, don’t use the lead. Some leads are much longer than others. I am not talking just about first sentences. I am talking about an integral beginning that sets a scene and implies the dimensions of the story. That might be a few words, a few hundred words. And it might be two thousand words, setting the scene for a story fifty times as long. A lead is good not because it dances, fires cannons, or whistles like a train but because it is absolute to what follows.

But contrast that with the incisive look at vegetables and fruits by Krish Ashok:

While fruits are designed to be attractive and delicious, vegetables and herbs are not. In fact, they are designed to keep animals from eating them. They tend to be hard to digest, and often possess nasty-tasting molecules. It is a testament to the remarkable nature of human ingenuity that we have figured out how to dig up a potato from the ground and turn it into the most scrumptious aloo fry using the process of cooking. The strong flavour of herbs like mint and coriander repel most insects. The sulphurous compounds in mustard, onions and garlic irritate not just insects but also animals grazing and trying to grab a quick bite. But humans tame their pungency and transform them into amazing flavours by cooking them.
